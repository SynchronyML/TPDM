# TPDM
A prediction model for umami and bitterness



**TastePeptides-DM** is the abbreviation of `TastePeptides Docking Machine learning`. It is a part of the [TastePeptides-Meta](http://tastepeptides-meta.com/) meta-universe. It is the docking-based part of the TastePeptides research framework. It is expected that through the docking of large quantities of TastePeptides:

- Find the conserved positions in the TastePeptides Point;

- Establish a taste peptide judgment model based on docking

- Give an accurate judgment about the taste of peptides

Beside,we introduce `The largest database of Taste Peptides`, [TastePeptidesDB](http://tastepeptides-meta.com/database/son/1)
